For connecting to CPANEL database, go to db_connect.php and you will see similir codes shown below:

define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost'); // Or your cPanel MySQL server hostname
define('DB_USERNAME', 'root'); // Your cPanel MySQL username
define('DB_PASSWORD', ''); // Your cPanel MySQL password
define('DB_NAME', 'news_week_db');     // The name of your database

Fill that with your database informations and always remember that "localhost" is always the DB Server even you connect to web hosting server, so don't be confuse.
